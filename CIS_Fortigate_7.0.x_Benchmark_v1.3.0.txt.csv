1.1 Ensure DNS server is configured (Automated) ,"Fortinet uses the Domain Name Service (DNS) to translate host names into IP addresses. To enable DNS lookups, you must specify the primary DNS server for your system. You can also specify secondary and tertiary DNS servers. When resolving host names, the system consults the primary name server. If a failure or time-out occurs, the system consults the secondary name server. For security purpose, trusted DNS servers should be configured to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  ","In CLI: FGT1 # config system dns FGT1 (dns) # show config system dns     set primary <ip_address>     set secondary <ip_address>     ... end In the GUI, go to Networks > DNS. The Fortigate uses either the default FortiGuard DNS or customized DNS  ","In this example, we will assign 8.8.8.8 as primary DNS and 8.8.4.4 as secondary DNS. In CLI: FGT1 # config system dns FGT1 (dns) # set primary 8.8.8.8 FGT1 (dns) # set secondary 8.8.4.4 FGT1 (dns) # end FGT1 # In the GUI, go to Networks > DNS. Click on ""Specify"" and put in 8.8.8.8 as ""Primary DNS Server"" and 8.8.4.4 as ""Secondary DNS Server"" Page 14 Default Value: Default primary DNS server is 96.45.45.45. Default secondary DNS server is 96.45.46.46.  "
1.2 Ensure intra-zone traffic is not always allowed (Manual) ,"This is to make sure that only specific, authorized traffic is allowed between networks in the same zone.  ","In this example, we'll verify the zone DMZ. In CLI: FGT1 # config system zone FGT1 (zone) # edit DMZ FGT1 (DMZ) # show full config system zone     edit ""DMZ""         ...         set intrazone deny         ...     next end In the GUI, click on Network -> Interfaces, select the zone and click on ""Edit"". Make sure that the option ""Block intra-zone traffic"" is enabled.  ","In this example, we'll turn off intra-zone traffic in the zone DMZ. In CLI: FGT1 # config system zone FGT1 (zone) # edit DMZ FGT1 (DMZ) # set intrazone deny FGT1 (DMZ) # end FGT1 # In the GUI, click on Network -> Interfaces, select the zone and click on ""Edit"" and turn on ""Block intra-zone traffic"" Default Value: By default, intra-zone traffic is blocked Page 16  "
1.3 Disable all management related services on WAN port ,"Enabling any management related services on WAN interface is high risk. Management related services such as HTTPS, HTTP, ping, SSH, SNMP, and Radius should be disabled on WAN.  ","On GUI: Go to ""Network"" > ""Interfaces"". Identify WAN interface and validate that HTTPS, HTTP, PING, SSH, SNMP, and Radius Accounting is not enabled in ""Administrative Access"" section. On CLI: `FGT1 # show system interface` Identify WAN interface and validate that ""set allowaccess"" does not have ping, https, http, ssh, snmp or radius-acct configured.  ","On GUI: Go to ""Network"" > ""Interfaces"". Review WAN interface and disable HTTPS, HTTP, ping, SSH, SNMP, and Radius services. On CLI: Page 18 FGT1 # config system interface FGT1 (interface) # edit ""port1"" FGT1 (port1) # unselect allowaccess ping https ssh snmp http radius-acct Note: 1. Interface name may differ based on deployment. For this example, port1 is deployed as WAN interface. 2. ""unselect allowaccess"" will only show services that you have enabled. If you have not enabled snmp on that interface, then snmp option will not be available.  "
2.1.1 Ensure 'Pre-Login Banner' is set (Automated) ,"Configure a pre-login banner, ideally approved by the organization’s legal team. This banner should, at minimum, prohibit unauthorized access, provide notice of logging or monitoring, and avoid using the word “welcome” or similar words of invitation.  ","Run the following command in the CLI to verify the pre-login-banner is enabled: FG1 # get system global  ...  pre-login-banner    : enable  ... end In the GUI, to verify the content of the pre-login disclaimer message: 1) Go to 'System' -> 'Replacement Messages' 2) From the top right side, select 'Extended View' 3) Find 'Pre-login Disclaimer Message'  ","Run the following command in the CLI to enable the pre-login-banner: FG1 # config system global FG1 (global) # set pre-login-banner enable FG1 (global) # end FG1 # In the GUI, to edit the content of the pre-login disclaimer message: Page 22 1.

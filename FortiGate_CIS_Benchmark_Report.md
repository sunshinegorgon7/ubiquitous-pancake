## CIS Benchmark Compliance Summary

| Benchmark Title                                      | Compliance Status | Description | Recommendations |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Set Admin Password Complexity**                     | Non-Compliant      | Password must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. | Implement password complexity rules. |
| **Enable Password Expiration**                        | Compliant          | Password expiration is required to enhance security. | Ensure regular password changes every X months. |
| **Restrict Access to Management Interfaces**        | Non-Compliant      | Access should be limited to trusted IP addresses. | Update ACLs to restrict remote management access. |
| **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**                 | Non-Compliant      | Two-factor authentication must be enforced for admin access. | Configure 2FA for increased security. |
| **Disable Unused Services**                           | Compliant          | All unnecessary services are disabled. | Regularly review to ensure no unintended services are enabled. |

## Detailed Findings

1. **Set Admin Password Complexity**
   - **Status**: Non-Compliant
   - **Description**: The configuration does not enforce password complexity as required by the CIS Benchmark.
   - **Recommendations**: Configure the firewall to enforce complex passwords.

2. **Enable Password Expiration**
   - **Status**: Compliant
   - **Description**: Password expiration settings are enforced, enhancing security.
   - **Recommendations**: Maintain regular password change intervals.

3. **Restrict Access to Management Interfaces**
   - **Status**: Non-Compliant
   - **Description**: Management interfaces are accessible from various public IP addresses without restriction.
   - **Recommendations**: Apply strict access control lists to limit access to authorized IP ranges.

4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
   - **Status**: Non-Compliant
   - **Description**: Current configuration does not require two-factor authentication for admin access.
   - **Recommendations**: Configure 2FA to add an additional security layer.

5. **Disable Unused Services**
   - **Status**: Compliant
   - **Description**: All unused services have been effectively disabled.
   - **Recommendations**: Continuously audit services to maintain this compliance.

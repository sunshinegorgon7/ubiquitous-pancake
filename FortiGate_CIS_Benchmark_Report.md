# FortiGate CIS Benchmark Compliance Report

---

## Overview

This report analyzes the FortiGate configuration against the CIS Benchmark. Each entry from the benchmark is evaluated for compliance based on the provided configuration.

## Compliance Summary

| No. | Title                                              | Compliance Status | Description                             | Recommendations                                          |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Set Admin Password Complexity                       | Non-Compliant     | Configuration does not enforce complexity for passwords. | Implement password complexity rules: at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. |
| 2   | Enable Password Expiration                          | Compliant         | Password expiration policies are defined and enforced. | Maintain current expiration policies (e.g., every 90 days). |
| 3   | Restrict Access to Management Interfaces            | Non-Compliant     | Management interfaces allow access from unauthorized IP addresses. | Restrict access to trusted IP ranges and configure firewall policies accordingly. |
| 4   | Enable Two-Factor Authentication                    | Non-Compliant     | Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is not enabled. | Implement 2FA for all admin accounts to enhance security. Enable 2FA settings in the management interface. |
| 5   | Disable Unused Services                             | Compliant         | All unnecessary services have been disabled. | Regularly review and remove any services not in use. |
| 6   | Configure Logging                                   | Non-Compliant     | Logging settings are not adequately configured to capture relevant events. | Configure logs for all administrative actions and security events. Regularly review logs for unauthorized access. |
| 7   | Enable Security Policies                            | Compliant         | Security policies are implemented in accordance with best practices. | Regularly review and adjust security policies to mitigate risk. |
| 8   | Apply Firmware Updates                              | Compliant         | Latest firmware is applied and updated as per guidance. | Set up alerts for firmware updates and apply them as necessary. |
| 9   | Enable IP Spoofing Protection                       | Non-Compliant     | IP spoofing protection is not configured. | Enable IP spoofing protection settings to prevent unauthorized access through IP disguise techniques. |
| 10  | Implement Web Filtering                             | Non-Compliant     | Web filtering is not fully enabled. | Implement web filtering policies and constraints on user access to harmful or non-work-related websites. |

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that several configuration items are non-compliant with the CIS Benchmark guidelines. Immediate actions are necessary to address these non-compliant areas to improve the overall security posture of the FortiGate device. Regular reviews of configurations against CIS will ensure continued compliance and resilience against security threats.
